## 2. Technical Architecture üõ†Ô∏è
### System Layers
| Layer               | Technology Stack          | Description                          |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Smart Contracts** | Solidity, OpenZeppelin     | ERC-1155 NFTs, token reward logic    |
| **Frontend**        | React, Ethers.js, Ant Design | User dashboard & NFT marketplace     |
| **Storage**         | IPFS, web3.storage         | Decentralized course file hosting    |
| **Oracle**          | Chainlink (simulated)      | Off-chain rating data integration    |

### Key Contracts
- **CourseNFT.sol**: Manages course minting/trading (ERC-1155 standard).
- **RewardToken.sol**: Distributes EDU rewards based on ratings.

## 3. Highlight Features ‚ú®
- **One-Click NFT Minting**:  
  Educators upload content to IPFS and mint courses as NFTs in <2 minutes.
- **Token-Gated Access**:  
  Students purchase NFTs using MetaMask; ownership unlocks content access.
- **Dynamic Rewards**:  
  Real-time token rewards for creators when ratings exceed a threshold.
- **Anti-Piracy Proof**:  
  All content hashes stored on-chain to verify authenticity.

## 4. Future Extensions (Bonus Tracks) üöÄ
- **DAO Governance**:  
  Let token holders vote on platform upgrades via Snapshot.
- **AI-Powered Curation**:  
  Integrate OpenAI to auto-generate course summaries and learning paths.
- **Cross-Chain Portability**:  
  Bridge EDU tokens to Ethereum/Polygon for broader accessibility.
- **Gamified Learning**:  
  Issue Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) as achievement badges.
